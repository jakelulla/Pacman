My final project was Pac Man.  My goal with this game was to create a maze, pacman, and ghosts. The pacman would be controlled by the user using the arrow keys and would navigate smoothly through the maze. The ghosts would be coded to move on their own. My goal was to have various different strategies of attack for each ghost. Lastly, I wanted to include a few different levels. 
I was successful with most of my goals, and even accomplished more than what I was originally expected. I was also able to add sound to my game, I developed a solid ghost update method with various different movement strategies for each ghosts, and I made three different levels.
A few things I would improve on my game are making the ghosts harder to avoid as the levels progress, adding the pacman fruits, and having the ghosts' eyes move back to the ghost house they are eaten. Additionally, I would use x and y instead of row and column because it would allow me to change speeds more smoothly.
